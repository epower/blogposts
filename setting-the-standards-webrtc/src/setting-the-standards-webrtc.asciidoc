== Conclusion ==
The W3C WebRTC WG are actively working on 2 documents for the Media Capture & Streams and MediaStream Recording, while the  IETF RTCWeb WG have 9 active draft documents in play at the moment.  Until all the standards have been set by W3C and IETF, and adapted by all interested parties we wonâ€™t celebrate the dawn of a new communication phase just yet.
